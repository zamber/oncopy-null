# oncopy=null

Literally add document.oncopy=null to pages.

Initially I was looking for a script/extension for disabling pastejacking but it didn't work for threatpost.com so this intricate beauty of a script was created.

I thought about adding a pastejacking fix too (you know, for a real event listener) but figured it would be too much work. Maybe I'll implement it as a feature later.
